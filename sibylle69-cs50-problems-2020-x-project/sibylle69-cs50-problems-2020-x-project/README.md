My project is a new game called "Zeubii".
There is a paddle at the bottom that can be moved right and left along the x axis with the keyboard. The paddle can reach
the right part of the screen by reaching the very left part of it.
The goal is to catch all the white squares that are falling down the screen. Each square caught adds a point to the score.
Zeubii has three states: "serve", "play" and "done". If you miss a square, then you fail. To try again, you can just press
"Enter" to update the score to zero and play again!

The score is displayed continuously, and some instructions guide you to start playing. Enjoy!
