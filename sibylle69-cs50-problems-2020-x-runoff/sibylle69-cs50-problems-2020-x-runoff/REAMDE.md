A program that runs a runoff election, allowing the user to input the number of candidates and the ranked votes to get the winner of the election. The code has been tested to handle
- An election with any number of candidate (up to the MAX of 9)
- Voting for a candidate by name
- Invalid votes for candidates who are not on the ballot
- Printing the winner of the election if there is only one
- Not eliminating anyone in the case of a tie between all remaining candidates
