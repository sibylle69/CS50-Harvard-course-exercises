A program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher, per the below. /n
$ ./caesar 13 /n
plaintext:  HELLO /n
ciphertext: URYYB /n
At the time the user executes the program, they should decide, by providing a command-line argument, on what the key should be in the secret message they’ll provide at runtime. It is not assumed that the user’s key is going to be a number; though we assume that, if it is a number, it will be a positive integer.
