Toward the end of World 1-1 in Nintendo’s Super Mario Brothers, Mario must ascend right-aligned pyramid of blocks. This scripts prompts the user for the pyramid’s height, stores their input in a variable, re-prompting the user again and again as needed if their input is not a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive. Then, it creates a right-aligned pyramid by pushing its hashes to the right and prefixing them with dots.
